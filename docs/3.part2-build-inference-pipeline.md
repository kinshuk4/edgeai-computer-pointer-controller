## Step 2: Build the Inference Pipeline



Using the *Inference Engine API*, you will need to build a pipeline that runs inference on the models using the inputs. The starter code includes methods that will help you set up this pipeline.

Before you start writing any code, the first step is just to get familiar with the starter files and how they will be used to construct the inference pipeline. We'll go over each file in the video below. You should open up the copy you downloaded and follow along.

### Get familiar with the starter code

Make sure you can locate each of these files—and that you have at least a basic understanding of how it will be used in the pipeline:

[ ] model.py
[ ] mouse_controller.py
[ ] input_feeder.py

### Make copies of the `model.py` file

The `model.py` file contains a sample class for loading, checking, and running inference on a single model. It also has methods to pre-process the inputs and outputs to the model, but these are not yet finished—that will be your job.Since each of the models has different requirements, you'll need to make a copy of `model.py` for each of the models. There are four models, so you should create four copies of `model.py` and rename them as follows:

### Complete the `model.py` code for each model

Inside the copies of `model.py` that you just made, you'll find several methods that are marked with `TODO` comments.It's your job to complete these methods for each of the three models, so that they accomplish the following goals:
