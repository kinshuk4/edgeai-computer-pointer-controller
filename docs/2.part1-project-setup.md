## Step 1: Project Setup



By the end of this task, you should have your dependencies installed and your project set up. Download and install OpenVino from [here](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/index.html).

### Download the starter files

We've provided some helpful starter files that you'll need for the project. You can download them [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e974e37_starter/starter.zip).**Note:** After you have downloaded the starter files, you should do all of your work inside the provided directory structureâ€”and when you're done, you'll zip and submit this entire directory structure. This will help ensure that we can successfully run your project and don't have problems getting your code working because of missing files or incorrect file paths.
