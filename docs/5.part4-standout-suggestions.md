## Part 4: Standout suggestions

If you've been having a good time with this project and want to take it further, here are some suggestions for a whole bunch of additional things you can do with it. If you want the additional practice or are wanting to turn this project into a nice portfolio piece, we recommend taking a shot at theseâ€”but note that these are all optional, so you can skip any (or all) of them and go straight to the project submission page.
